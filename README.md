# Zuul_Game_refactored._Assignment_1_of_Advanced_Java_Module
This project involved taking the Zuul game from BlueJ book and refactoring the game 


This is an extract from the assignment brief:


Motivation for the task. The purpose of this task is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned as areflective, 
object-oriented programmer. At the heart of the assignment is a very badly constructedpiece of code which you have to critique and refactor. 
You need to apply all you have learnedabout responsibility driven design.  In particular, you should consider what design patterns areappropriate 
for this program.Be very clear that this assignment requires a substantial amount of refactoring.For example,solutions that retain the
existing structure of the code will not achieve a pass mark.The background brief is deliberately under-specified, as is common with briefs
from clients in thereal world.Note that the company has ambitions for future developments that your solution mustsupport.
•  Solutions that permit future developments with only very limited changes to the code arelikely to get good marks;
•  Solutions  that  allow  such  developments without  any  changes  to  the  code  that  you  have already written will obtain excellent marks.

Background:For some unknown reason (1980s nostalgia?), the small games company that you work for hasdecided to produce a new adventure game,
The World of Zuul. The company hopes that this willbe the first of a series of products (some in the Zuul series, others quite different but 
all sharingthe same underlying structure). It is therefore essential that the code produced is easy to maintainand to extend.  They plan to
release games in single-player and multi-player versions.  They also intend to have some AI (artificial intelligence) —computer-controlled
characters than can movethrough the game. As team leader, you asked an intern from Parkwood Metropolitan University to produce an initial prototype
with a simple command-line interface. 

The module page contains a link to a zip fileof his prototype,zuul-bad-extended.zip :  it is dreadful.  It clearly cannot be extended in its present form, yet alone support
any of your company’s ambitions (see above). Clearly, you are going to have to refactor itbefore it meets all these goals.

Your task for this assignment: refactor the prototype and implement the missing features listed below in order to remedy the prototype’s shortcomings.  
Third, peer mark some solutions.Fourth, meet me for feedback. 
You must complete all of these tasks.Read these instructions and the background very carefully. 
In particular, pay attention tothe requirements and future plans of the company. Your solution must support all of them.
